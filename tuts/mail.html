This program downloads mail from server. See man mbsync</li>

This program tags received mail and indexes them. For eg, an email about
rock music can be tagged with "rock", "music", etc so that later, we can
search them.</li>
<li>afew
This program is to handle automatic-tagging to notmuch. while it is
possible to do it directly through notmuch, afew makes it easier</li>

mbsync is the program developed by isync project.
mbsync looks for a file ~/.mbsyncrc for it's configuration. Since it
downloads mail, it needs your password too. It's better to use app-passwords
if your provider supports them and use `pass` to get password.
</p>

<p>
See it's arch-wiki page for more details.
The structure and meaning of relevant block is included in the example

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-2">
<p>
Notmuch indexes mails so you can search within the mail. It also stores tags
for organization. See `man notmuch` which has very good documentation.
</p>

<p>
Run `notmuch setup` so that it does all the initial heavylifting.
Then, edit ~/.notmuch-config with the option below. The config file itself
is very well written and you <b>should</b> read it.
</p>

<p>
After receiving mail, you should run `notmuch new`.
</p>

<p>
This config makes it so new mails are tagged with tag "new" only. Everything
else should be handled by afew.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-conf">#Find the correct line and make it as below
[new]
  tags=new;
  ignore=
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3a4a78d" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org3a4a78d"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.3</span> afew</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-3">
<p>
Afew makes it easy to automatically tag new messages into whatever
tag you like. While notmuch can do it too, it is more complex and
afew is a lot more easier to write filters.
</p>

<p>
You can even download filters from internet as python files that
implement much complex filters. Just download filter and add it to
~/.config/afew/.
</p>

<p>
The man page of afew is very well written. Read it.
</p>

<p>
You can alias this command to run mbsync, notmuch and afew at
once.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">alias mailsync="mbsync -a &amp;&amp; notmuch new &amp;&amp; afew --tag --new"
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc66d9d7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgc66d9d7"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.4</span> emacs</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-4">
<p>
Finally, to read messages, install `notmuch-emacs` package from
your distro's repo. Then type `M-x notmuch` and view on a tag like
`new` or `all mail`.
