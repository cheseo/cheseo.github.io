I've found that to learn something, immersing oneself in it is very effective.
<p>For an example, I wanted to learn 9front from a long time ago. Until now, i had made very little progress in it.
Trying to use drawterm with it just didn't make me use _it_.
However, now, for a couple of days, i've tried to just boot it on metal and use only that for extended periods. It instantly made me appreciate the os and now i'm familiar with some of it's quircks!

I beleive the same technique may work for others too; although i haven't really tried. I guess the actual gist of this is to actually do what you inted to do.
While that may be succient description, i beleive we need long winded methods of explaning things to make us see the same stuff from different angles. Some angles will click while others will fall flat.

now, how do i immerse myself to musical instruments!?
