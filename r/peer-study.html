I feel that studying with a peer is a much better to study or rather, do anything at all.
<p>
Up until 10th grade, i exclusively studied with peers, in classrooms. They'd find a problem hard and we'd solve it together.
This continued until many people in my class started to ask me for help. This eventually lead me to encountering progressively harder questions and mastering them before moving on. The effect of this is that i never really needed "study" per se.
During college years, this changed as all my friends changed schools. The new peers would often study on their own and i didn't really get to study with them at all. I don't really like the very strict private schools, and this experience is one of the reason why.
Our college kept us like cattles and we'd have to move according to their barks, doing exactly what they said.
This led to few isolated moments with peers since the only time when we weren't being lectured by teachers would be the break which was very short.
This instituotinalized approach is a reason i beleive for the low socialization among people there.
I feel strongly that even on other organizations, where people don't have much leisure time, this eventually happens, and people can't socialize properly.
Big Corporations (eww) may want this since fewer socialization would probably mean people associating themselves with their work only which would "boost" things for them. However this effect is, ofc, bad for the people involved.

Returning to the topic at hand, In my uni years(which is now) i've started to study with peers again.
Granted time is nearing towards the end and i less than a few years with them -- i realised this too late but the best time to realize it is now.
I did want to start a <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/book-clubs">book club</a> but i'm not sure how i can conduct that properly; people do seem interested however it's in a sort of limbo right now. Some of us are studying in sort of a "peer programming" session -- two people on the same laptop dealing with the same problem. This seems to give much better result when both of us know some preliminary knowledge of the topic and have a working prototype and want to extend that or understand it. Extending something is a good way to understand it i've found but only if you already know some basics to not get stuck at every point.

I have nothing to concluion here -- after all this is just a rambling; I just wanted to express that studying with other people is probably much better -- it is better for me atleast if i can find like-minded people -- than studying everything alone. I'm very bad at the latter so that may be the cause of my bias, though.
