  Spending time: perhaps a better way.  
  </head>
  <body>
    This is the advice i found on ****chan and would like to save here for future references.<br>
    A webpage (html) is probably not a great idea for things like these since i won't really read these.<br>
    <br>
    Things to do:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Try more crafts
      </li>
      <li> Focus on creation than on consumption. <br>
	E.g. if you like reading, try writing. if you like music, try playing musical instruments.<br>
	This type of learning is craftsmanship and very different than the typical school learning.
      </li>
      <li>
	Increase time you exercise. There is no downside to this, it will help you in everything else. <br>
	Try lifting weights and going for walks. basically free. <br>
	Join a gym.
      </li>
      <li>
	Stop staring at this screen for so long! 
      </li>
      <li>
	Talk to people (perhaps on the phone)
      </li>
      <li>
	And start following a schedule for important (for any human) things like waking up, eating, sleeping, etc.<br>
	(to that regard, i'm off to sleep.)
      </li>
    </ul>
